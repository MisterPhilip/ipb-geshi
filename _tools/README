The tools included:

 * cssgen2.php
    This will build the CSS for all the files within the GeSHi language directory.
      To use this file, you should place it within /admin/sources/classes/text/parser/bbcode/sources/geshi
      You can then call it via the command line, `php cssgen.php > geshi.css`. From there, you should 
      merge the geshi.css file that was output with the one currently in the css directory. By default, that 
      is located at /public/style_css/geshi.css
